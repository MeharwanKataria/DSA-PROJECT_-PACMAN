# DSA-PROJECT_-PACMAN
🟡 Pac-Man Game (DSA Project)
📖 Project Description

This project is a Pac-Man game implementation developed as part of a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course.
The game is built using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and audio.

The project demonstrates practical usage of DSA concepts, game logic, file handling, and object-oriented programming through an interactive desktop game.
